# Week 9 - Honey Pot

# Honey Pot Used
The only honeypot I used was Dionaea

#Issues
The only issue that I encountered was in milestone 2 when we had to install the application.
The given commands were not working on my computer.
$ cd /opt
$ sudo git clone https://github.com/RedolentSun/mhn.git
$ cd mhn
$ sudo ./install.sh

To resolve this issue, I used these commands instead:

$ cd /opt/
$ sudo git clone https://github.com/threatstream/mhn.git
$ cd mhn/
$ sudo ./install.sh

After that point, the only issue that I had was running nmap on the IP address. For some reason it was not working on my compter so I ran it on the same IP using my kali vm and it worked from there.

# Further Questions
I did not have any further questions from the material in this lab. The instructions were pretty straight forward and I was able to understand what was being done.
